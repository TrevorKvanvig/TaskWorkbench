**Overview**

Task Workbench is a team task tracking software that streamlines the process of creating and managing tasks.

I like to stay organized and keep track of my tasks in a way where I can see the progress I am completing. Therefore, I solo developed this comprehensive Full Stack application to do just that.

**Features**

* Integrated a RESTful API for seamless data transmission, reception, and manipulation.

* Implemented robust security measures, including mandatory bearer token API key authentication and cryptographic hash function-based password encryption, to safeguard user data. This Feature is used when both logging in and signing up
